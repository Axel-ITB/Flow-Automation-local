# Modular Flow Gating Script
#setwd("C:/Users/AxelBergenstr√•le/OneDrive - ITB-MED AB/Desktop/R Projects/FACS Automation local")

# This script provides a set of small, composable gating methods that can be
# chained together. Each method isolates one peak from a density distribution by
# cutting off the surrounding valleys. The methods are numbered so that users can
# specify a sequence like c(1, 3, 5) to apply several gating strategies in
# order.

# Method 1: isolate the dominant peak (works with any number of peaks)
# Method 2: two peaks, keep the left one
# Method 3: two peaks, keep the right one
# Method 4: three peaks, keep the left one
# Method 5: three peaks, keep the middle one
# Method 6: three peaks, keep the right one
